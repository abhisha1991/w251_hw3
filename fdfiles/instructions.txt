These are the instructions for the face detector publisher module.

- We start a face detector container by first building the image under fdfiles
- We do this by going to the fdfiles directory and doing "docker build . -t fdimage1"
- Next we create a network bridge for our broker container to be able to interact with our forwarder container + publisher: "docker network create --driver bridge hw03"
- Next we start the broker on the Tx2 with the networking bridge:
- "docker run -dit  --network hw03 --name mosquitto1 -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto" 
- This establishes a broker that is listening on port 1833 for all IP addresses on the host node
- Next we start our image publisher container: "docker run -dit --network hw03 --name fdpub1  fdimage1"   
- At this point, if we inspect the logs of the publisher we notice that the data is being published
- However, it needs to be received by the forwarder and it needs to be re-published to the remote ibm cloud VSI
- So next, we need to set up the image forwarder module, please look at instructions.txt within fwderfiles for next steps
