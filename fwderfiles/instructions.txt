These are the instructions for the image forwarder module.

- Please read this after going through the face detector module
- Most of the steps are the same as setting up the face detector module
- Here we have 2 clients, one that is a subscriber that listens to incoming messages from the broker
- The other just republishes the payload it receives, this time to the remote ibm cloud machine 50.22.169.235
- Note that the broker connections can be set up using the container name directly "mosquitto1" instead of giving a specific IP address
- Why? Because we have already established the network bridge where all containers can ping each other: "docker network create --driver bridge hw03"
- For the forwarder, we just start our forwarding container (after building the image) as follows: docker run -dit --name fwd1 --network hw03 fdwimage1
- **Notice the difference in topic names in our containers**
- Within the TX2, we have used the topic "fdimagestx2/test" between the image publish container and the forwarder
- Between the TX2 and the cloud broker vm, we have used a different topic name "fdimages/test"
- Also **notice the difference in the client connection IDs in our containers**
- Within the TX2, we have used the connection ID "P1tx2" for the publisher and forwarder containers
- Between the TX2 and the cloud container, we have used a different client connection ""P1"
